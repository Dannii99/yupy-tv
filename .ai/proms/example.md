## PROM PARA CREAR VISTA NUEVA

Task: Create the main admin layout from scratch for Yupi TV Admin.

Goal:
Build the base application shell for the admin portal using the current project standards.

Requirements:

- Create a responsive main layout with:
  - left sidebar navigation
  - top header
  - main content area
- The layout must align with the product identity defined in /.ai/project-context.md and /.ai/ui-visual-guidelines.md

## Prompt recomendado para implementar Dark/Light mode

Task: Implement dark mode and light mode switching from the Settings page.

Context:
The application already supports a dark theme through Tailwind's `dark` class and color tokens defined in the UI reference.

Goal:
Allow the user to switch between dark mode and light mode from the Settings page.

Requirements:

- Add a theme toggle inside the Settings page
- The toggle should allow switching between:
  - Dark mode
  - Light mode
- The theme change should update the root `html` element by adding or removing the `dark` class
- Persist the user preference using localStorage so the theme is restored on page reload
- The theme should apply globally across the layout and all pages

Implementation notes:

- Prefer a simple theme service if needed
- Keep the logic lightweight
- Do not introduce unnecessary global state
- Use Angular Signals for local UI state where appropriate
- Ensure the toggle integrates cleanly with the existing layout

UI requirements:

- The toggle should follow the visual guidelines defined in:
  /.ai/ui-visual-guidelines.md
- The control should be simple and consistent with the Settings page style
- Prefer a modern toggle or segmented control rather than a plain checkbox

Constraints:

- Do not redesign the Settings page entirely
- Do not create new modules or features unrelated to theme switching
- Do not refactor unrelated code
- Modify the existing implementation

Implementation notes:

- Use CSS compatible with both WebKit and Firefox
- Apply the styles globally if appropriate
- Avoid breaking default scrolling behavior
- Keep the implementation lightweight

Constraints:

- Do not modify unrelated styles
- Do not redesign components
- Make the smallest safe change possible

Follow all /.ai/\*.md project guides.

## Prompt corto para layout resposive tipo ionic

Task: Improve the responsive behavior of the existing main layout for tablet and mobile screens.

Context:
The main layout already exists and works well on desktop.
Do NOT redesign the desktop layout.
Do NOT rebuild the layout from scratch.

Goal:
Adapt the existing layout so that on tablet and mobile it behaves more like a polished mobile app shell, inspired by Ionic-style mobile navigation patterns, while still matching the current product visual identity.

Responsive Intent:

- Keep the current desktop layout as-is for large screens
- For tablet and mobile, transform the experience into a more mobile-friendly layout
- The mobile/tablet experience should feel app-like, clean, and premium
- This is a simulation of a mobile app shell inside the web app, not a literal Ionic implementation

Mobile/Tablet Requirements:

- Replace or adapt the desktop sidebar behavior for small screens
- Use a mobile-friendly navigation pattern such as:
  - top bar + bottom navigation
    or
  - top bar + drawer
    whichever best fits the current product
- The responsive layout must feel intentional and aesthetically integrated with the dark premium design
- Navigation should remain clear and easy to use on smaller screens
- The layout should preserve access to the main sections:
  - Dashboard
  - Streamers
  - Favorites
  - Games
  - Settings

Design Goals:

- The mobile/tablet layout should feel similar to a modern app shell
- It should feel elegant, not cramped
- It should preserve the current dark-first, premium streaming/admin identity
- It should not look like a generic admin dashboard squeezed into a phone screen

Constraints:

- Do NOT break the desktop experience
- Do NOT redesign unrelated pages
- Do NOT create unrelated new features
- Modify only the main layout and the minimum supporting responsive navigation structure required
- Preserve existing routing and navigation flow
- Do not refactor unrelated code
- Make the smallest safe set of changes needed to achieve a strong responsive experience

Implementation Notes:

- Use responsive Tailwind utilities
- Keep Angular structure intact
- Keep template logic light
- Reuse existing navigation items and routing
- Prioritize a polished responsive shell over large structural rewrites

UI Direction:

- Follow /.ai/ui-visual-guidelines.md
- Keep the purple primary identity
- Use rounded surfaces, subtle borders, and polished spacing
- Ensure the responsive navigation feels coherent with the rest of the application

Follow these project guides strictly:

- /.ai/rules.md
- /.ai/ownership.md
- /.ai/architecture.md
- /.ai/execution.md
- /.ai/project-context.md
- /.ai/ui-patterns.md
- /.ai/ui-visual-guidelines.md

Desktop must remain the baseline; mobile and tablet should be adaptive variants of the existing layout, not a separate redesign.

For small screens, prefer a bottom navigation or compact mobile shell over a collapsed desktop sidebar.
